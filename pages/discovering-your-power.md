**An introduction from Dominique Morgan**

Your story has power. If you have experienced the system firsthand or through somebody you care about, Discovering Your Power sessions offer an opportunity to **amplify your power** through unpacking your lived experience.

Across four activities, we will find power in our lived experience, **speak against oppression**, **explore and expand our purpose**, and **build a sense of community**.

The four activities center on **support**, **relationships**, **fear**, and **guilt**. In each exercise, you will have the opportunity to examine what you think about these topics, dig deeper into your experience, and think about how they show up in your life. **You will be supported as you think about your journey's next steps** and how you will use your power.

When we were developing Discovering Your Power, it was not our intention to tell you what to think. There are enough people telling you, especially if you have been impacted by the system, what is right and wrong, helpful or hurtful. I have learned that **you have to define your life for yourself**.

In Discovering Your Power sessions, **you are the only true expert on your life** because only you have lived it. If you are willing to examine your experiences – unpacking them, looking at all the players – you will be able to engage in an accountability practice. You will reflect on what has happened in your life and discover how you might work towards something more in line with what you want for your life. When you learn from your own story, you get to look to yourself for inspiration.

We have conducted dozens of these sessions with young people who have been impacted by the system, with adults, and with adults caring for system-impacted youth.

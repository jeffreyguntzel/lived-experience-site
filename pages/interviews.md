If you have experienced the system firsthand or through somebody you care about, we are interested in interviewing you.

Interviews are confidential and focus on your lived experience. You are the only expert on your life, and when you sit for an interview with our lead interviewer Racquel Henderson or other team members, we always regard your story as *yours*. If you decide you would rather not be a part of the project after participating in an interview, we will send you any files we have and delete our copies.

To read more about our interview process, read lead interviewer Racquel Hendersonâ€™s blog post: [Our work is about Healing](/2021/02/25/our-work-is-about-healing/).

To learn more about interviews, please contact [Racquel Henderson](mailto:racquel@terralunacollaborative.com).

*Our interview work is governed by an **Independent Review Board (IRB)** which reviews and approves our interview process, consent and assent form language, and interview guides.*

**An introduction from Dominique Morgan**

Your story has power. If you have experienced the system firsthand or through somebody you care about, Discovering Your Power sessions offer an opportunity to amplify your power through unpacking your lived experience.

Across four activities, we will find power in our lived experience, cultivate and speak against oppression, explore and expand our purpose, and build a sense of community.

The four activities center on support, relationships, fear, and guilt. In each activity, you will have the opportunity to discover what you think about these topics, to dig deeper into your experience and think about how they show up in your life. You will think about the next steps in your journey and how you will use your power.

When we were developing Discovering Your Power, it was not my intention to tell you what to think, what is right and what is wrong. There are enough people telling youth, especially those impacted by the system, what to think and what is right and wrong. What I have learned is that you have to define your life for yourself.

In Discovering Your Power sessions, you are the expert -- you are the expert in your life because youâ€™ve lived it. If you have the drive to look through your lived experience and learn from what happened, by unpacking it and by looking at all the players, you will be able to engage in accountability practice to think about what happened and how may have ended up differently. When you learn from your own story, you get to look to *yourself* for inspiration.

We've conducted dozens of these sessions, including special sessions with parents of system-involved youth and with adults who have been system-involved as youths and as adults. If you are interested in learning how you can particpate or host a session, please contact Racquel Henderson at racquel@terralunacollaborative.com.

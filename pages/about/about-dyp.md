**An Introduction from Dominique Morgan**

Your story has power. If you have experienced the system firsthand or through somebody you care about, Discovering Your Power sessions offer an opportunity to **amplify your power** through unpacking your lived experience.

Across four activities, we will find power in our lived experience, **speak against oppression**, **explore and expand our purpose**, and **build a sense of community**.

The four activities center on support, relationships, fear, and guilt. In each activity, you will have the opportunity to examine what you think about these topics, dig deeper into your experience, and think about how they show up in your life. **You will be supported as you think about the next steps in your journey and how you will use your power**.

When we were developing Discovering Your Power, it was not my intention to tell you what to think. There are enough people telling youth, especially those impacted by the system, what is right and wrong, helpful or hurtful. I have learned that **you have to define your life for yourself**.

In Discovering Your Power sessions, **you are the expert in your life**, because only *you* have lived it. If you have the willingness to look through your experiences -- unpacking them, looking at all the players --  you will be able to engage in an accountability practice. You will be able to reflect on what has happened in your life and discover how you might work towards something more in line with what you want for your life. When you learn from your own story, you get to look to *yourself* for inspiration.

We have conducted dozens of these sessions,with young people who have been impacted by the system, with adults, and with adults caring for system-impacted youth.

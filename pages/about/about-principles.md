The Project's principles, inputs, activities, and outputs are designed to support efforts to influence juvenile justice institutions towards centering the lived experience of current and former system-impacted youth and families---an antidote to the reality describe in the Project's research problem:

> Juvenile justice institutions do not center or privilege the voices and lived experiences of youth and young adults who have experienced arrest, diversion, probation, juvenile court, detention, and treatment.
>
> As a result, these institutions risk causing and perpetuating harm through policies, practices, and programs that fail to identify and meet urgent needs.
The proposal describes how the Project will work and report to the Foundation.

This includes how we manage communication, project learning, and discussions about supporting similar work beyond the scope of the Project.

### GUIDING PRINCIPLES
The Project is guided by three sets of principles. The foundational principles are our shared beliefs which guide our mission critical decisions. Our principles of research conduct guide our interactions with youth and families. Our principles of research use guide how we put our findings into action.

#### FOUNDATIONAL PRINCIPLES

These principals guide all of our work.

**Listen and believe**
We create space for anyone who has been impact by the juvenile justice system. These individuals are encouraged to share their stories while extending the gift of deep listening and belief.

**Inherent goodness in every person**
We honor the inherent goodness in all individuals, despite the harm they may be responsible for.

**Child and adolescent development science**
Our work recognizes and draws upon the ever-growing body of scientific knowledge about the behaviors and capacities of children and adolescents.

**Trauma reduction**
Our work seeks to reduce the harm and trauma that children, youth, and families experience within the juvenile justice system and at its edges.

#### RESEARCH CONDUCT PRINCIPLES

These principles guide all of our research activities.

**Integrity of process**
We work to ensure all research activities contribute to the integrity and credibility of our data and findings.

**Integrate multiple disciplines**
We incorporate a range of research and evaluation disciplines in our work to discover and uncover the lived experiences of the juvenile justice system.

**Cultural responsiveness**
We work to ensure the team conducting research, making sense of stories, and building relationships with community are trustworthy and reflect the values and experiences of system-impacted people.

#### RESEARCH USE PRINCIPLES

These principles that guide all of our research use and transfer activities.

**Develop and account for the personal factor among gatekeepers**
We start with and understand what system gatekeepers want to learn, then build towards what the need to learn.

**Respond to the values and institutional logic of users**
We frame the usefulness of learning from system-impact persons within the limits and boundaries system gatekeepers and stakeholders operate within.

**Speak truth with grace**
We work to illuminate difficult and complex issues and cultivate accountability with sensitivity to the complexities of human systems.

**Engage creatively**
We aim to activate the whole person in our use and transfer work, recognizing the multiple identities, depths of experience, and emotional complexity of every individual.

**Start with (and stay with) youth, families, and community**
We work for change alongside those who are system-impacted. We recognize that it is the stories they've lent us that give the Project its potential.

The Lived Experience Project is a juvenile justice research project that centers the lived experiences of system impacted youth and their families. Our facilitation provides a unique opportunity to reflect, review, and reassess how we work with and support youth who are impacted by various systems, as well as how we support their families. Our facilitations are crafted utilizing actual data provided by system impacted youth, adults who were system impacted as youth, as well as their families.

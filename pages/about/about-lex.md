We are an Omaha-based juvenile justice research and facilitation project that centers the experiences of system-impacted youth and their families.

Our Discovering Your Power sessions

Our system facing facilitations provide a unique opportunity to reflect, review, and reassess how we work with and support youth who are impacted by various systems, as well as how we support their families. Our facilitations are crafted utilizing actual data provided by system impacted youth, adults who were system impacted as youth, and their families.

### What is the Lived Experience Project

The Lived Experience project seeks to collect stories from youth and adults with experience in the Douglas County juvenile justice system, in Douglas County, Nebraska. These stories, collected through interviews, are analyzed patterns of experience and used as part of an effort to inform system stakeholders and concerned citizens about the ways young people and their families are impacted by the policies and practices of the Douglas County juvenile justice system, and as a way to facilitate engagement with youth and family voice by those engaged in reform efforts.

### LEX Guiding Principles

- Listen and believe
- Integrity of process
- Profound goodness and beauty in every child
- Child development science
- Trauma has compounding and life-long effects

### Goals

One of the guiding principles in our work is sharing power. One of the ways that principle has informed our work is to ensure everyone on the Lived Experience team is compensated well, and at the same level. For this project we have taken into consideration: a) opportunity costs in the labor market; b) the evenings and weekends that the team puts into the project; and c) the amount of pain and trauma that our team is exposed to through this work.

### What is TerraLuna

The TerraLuna collaborative is a cooperative consulting firm specializing in creative evaluation, research, and systems change for social justice and civil rights. We uncover how and why efforts for change are working well, when and where they aren't working well, and we develop innovative solutions that help schools, communities, non-profit organizations, businesses, and local governments overcome barriers to change. Based in Minneapolis, TerraLuna has been doing work in Omaha for more than five years and includes Omaha based staff, consultants, and board members

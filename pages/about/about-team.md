**Placeholder text:** Your story has power. If you have experienced the system firsthand or through somebody you care about, Discovering Your Power sessions offer an opportunity to amplify your power through unpacking your lived experience.

Across four activities, we will find power in our lived experience, cultivate and speak against oppression, explore and expand our purpose, and build a sense of community.

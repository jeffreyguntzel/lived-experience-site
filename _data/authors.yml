  bio: |+
      Jeff Severns Guntzel does journalism for the web, on paper, and occasionally for the radio. He has been known to do journalism from the command line and in comic books.
      He has worked for really great people at American Public Media, MinnPost, Utne Reader, National Catholic Reporter and Punk Planet magazine. Now he is living the freelance life and loving it very much. Before turning to journalism, Jeff spent years doing humanitarian work in pre-war Iraq. Electronic Iraq, a website he co-founded in 2003 to document the Iraqi experience of war, is archived in the Library of Congress and the British Library. That is a good thing because libraries are great and those libraries are amazing!

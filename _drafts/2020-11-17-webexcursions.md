[Youth Detention Admissions Remain Low, But Releases Stall Despite COVID-19 (Annie E. Casey Foundation)](https://www.aecf.org/blog/youth-detention-admissions-remain-low-but-releases-stall-despite-covid-19/)
: A new report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation describes the results of their survey of juvenile justice agencies in 33 states.  Key findings from the report (in the Foundation's wording): > - Secure detention populations, which had been falling since March, increased slightly in May due to too few releases of young people from detention, not an influx of new admissions. > - The decrease in population was driven primarily by a steep decline in the rate of admissions. > - Juvenile justice systems had increasing difficulty releasing young people who were detained. > - One of every three young people in detention on June 1, 2020, would not have been in detention if the release rate had stayed at its March level. > Disparities in admissions improved for African American youth when the juvenile justice system had a smaller footprint. > - Disparities in release rates that disadvantage Black youth grew, which led to lower overall population declines for Black youth than for white youth.

[Virus-Driven Push to Release Juvenile Detainees Leaves Black Youth Behind (New York Times)](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/us/politics/juvenile-detainees-coronavirus.html)
: NYT education reporter Erica L. Green reports on an Annie E. Casey Foundation report about COVID-19 releases at youth detention facilities. The foundation found that COVID-related white release rate has been 17 percent higher than the Black release rate. Pre-COVID, the white release rate was 7 percent higher. The article quotes the Sentencing Project's Joshua Rovner: > "We should be happy that many youth are being released who should have never been there in the first place ... I donâ€™t want to minimize the fact that white youth are benefiting from that, but the data speak for itself: All of our kids are not being treated equally."

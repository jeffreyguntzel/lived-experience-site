*Racquel Henderson has been lead interviewer for the Lived Experience Project since early-2017 (It's just one part of a rich, rich life of helping, listening, and teaching). I asked her if she would be willing to sit on the other side of the microphone to talk with me about why she does this work and what she has experienced and learned along the way.*

**Jeff Severns Guntzel:** You've done so, so many interviews as part of this project. You had never interviewed before, and now you are a veteran of the craft. You came into this work having lived your own system experiences. What happened inside you after those first few interviews?

**Racquel Henderson:** Visualize a dam. It was like a dam -- it has this big, strong wall that's been holding the water back for all these years. When I started doing interviews, the wall started to crumble. Slowly at first. It started in itty bitty pieces -- a crack here, a crumble there. Then all of a sudden, after so many crumbles and cracks, it just bust -- BOOM -- and everything comes flooding in. Everything that you thought that you had got over, or got under, or forgot about, or maybe you thought that you healed from.

**JSG:** What exactly is the water? What is the everything you thought you had got over?

**RH:** The water was my own lived experience in the juvenile justice system. It was issues I had growing up -- with being shifted from one family member to another when my mom was sick. Not knowing my biological family. The toxic relationships. The physical, sexual, and verbal abuse. The saying yes when I wanted to say no. And the saying no and it not meaning anything. Just all those things.

**JSG:** Was it the totality of what you were hearing from interviewees or was a crack when somebody talks about physical abuse, another crack when somebody talks about saying no and it not meaning anything?

**RH:** It was everything. Maybe my first interview was nothing, and then the second and third there was a little crack. And then the fourth, fifth, and sixth made a whole piece of rubble come out.

**JSG:** Was there a point that you remember the dam giving way comepletely? Where you knew it *all* the water was coming?

**RH:** It was upon me before I realized it.

**JSG:** We were just getting to know each other in those days. What clues would I have had that you were going through this?

**RH:** I was just keeping it. I was just keeping it. 

**JSG:** Does it still feel like you are in the water when you're doing this work?

**RH:** It depends. There are times when I'm floating on the water, times when I'm sinking, times when I'm swimming. And there are times when the wall is getting put back together.

**JSG:** Like the water on the other side of the dam has receded enough that you can patch up some cracks?

**RH:** Yeah.

**LEX Team: I'm adding the rest tomorrow morning...**

*Racquel Henderson has been lead interviewer for the Lived Experience Project since early-2017 (It's just one part of a rich, rich life of helping, listening, and teaching). I asked her if she would be willing to sit on the other side of the microphone to talk with me about why she does this work and what she has experienced and learned along the way.*

**Jeff Severns Guntzel:** You've done so, so many interviews as part of this project. You had never interviewed before, and now you are a veteran of the craft. You came into this work having lived your own system experiences. What happened inside you after those first few interviews?

**Racquel Henderson:** Visualize a dam. It was like a dam -- it has this big, strong wall that's been holding the water back for all these years. When I started doing interviews, the wall started to crumble. Slowly at first. It started in itty bitty pieces -- a crack here, a crumble there. Then all of a sudden, after so many crumbles and cracks, it just bust -- BOOM -- and everything comes flooding in. Everything that you thought that you had got over, or got under, or forgot about, or maybe you thought that you healed from.

**JSG:** What exactly is the water? What is the everything you thought you had got over?

**LEX Team: I'm adding the rest tomorrow morning...**

Welcome to the Lived Experience Project website! We've been around for a while, this here is brand new. Sending gratitude to [Ryan Pitts](https://twitter.com/ryanpitts?lang=en) who did early foundational work for the site, and to [Brett Terpstra](https://brettterpstra.com) who built and designed the site, and who has done an incredible job creating custom features to suit our unique needs.

We are graced here with the artwork of [Odera Igbokwe](https://www.odera.net/). We are so humbled to have had the opportunity to collaborate with such a profoundly intuitive and spirit-rich artist.

I can't wait for you to experience the fullness of our site. We have *lots* of exciting things in store in 2021, including interviews, original reporting, audio diaries, and a portal for reports and other data from Douglas County and Nebraska agencies.

If you are looking to learn more about who we are and what we do, here are some hepful links:
